# Rock-Paper-Scissors-animation
Just a button that runs through a rock paper scissors animation and then outputs one of them.

* Must have 3 separate images of Rock, Paper, and Scissor hand gestures

* Each on should also have their own distinct color

* Button should run through an animation in a box that is big enough for said images

* Once it lands on said result, you should be able to press the button to run it through again
